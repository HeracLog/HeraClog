Welcome stranger to my github profile!, I'd offer you a drink but you won't be here for long, I am Youssef Salah, a 19-year old computer science student at Alexandria University, majoring in Intelligent Systems, I love both AI and the math behind it (especially the math, if you know me irl you are probably sick of it lmao), I have a passion for teaching others and connecting with them!!
## Fields of Interest 
* Programming in general, desiging algorithms has always been a passion of mine!
* Optimization, where it is constrained, linear, non-linear, I love it (yes I am nerd, deal with it).
* Artifical Intelligence, despite the magic behind it being gone since I know how it works; It is still one of my favourite topics!!
* Writing, it has always been a passion of mine, mapping my ideas and creativity in the form of words will never not be fun!
* Poetry and Music, although I write really sappy stuff. If anyone ever saw the stuff I write, I would be in a mental asylum.
* Last but certainly not least, MATHS (I know mentioned it before BUT GOD I LOVE MATHS!!)

So yeah if you ever feel like this mentally ill nerd is interesting (I know I am, thank you very much), don't hesitate to hit me up and I'll explain finding optimization solutions in complex search spaces to you!
