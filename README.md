## About me 😃
Welcome to my github profile stranger!, I'd offer you a drink but you won't be here for long (no loitering!!). <br>
Hello!! I am Youssef Salah, a 19-year old computer science student at Alexandria University, majoring in Intelligent Systems 🧠, I love both AI and the maths behind it (especially the maths, if you know me irl you are probably sick of it lmao), I have a passion for teaching others and connecting with them, which is part of the reason why I plan on pursuing post graduate studies (the other parts being my love for research and other minor stuff)!!
## Fields of Interest 💡
* 👨‍💻 Programming in general, designing algorithms has always been a passion of mine!
* 📊 Optimization, whether it is constrained, linear, non-linear, I love it (yes I am nerd 🤓, deal with it).
* 🧠 Artifical Intelligence, despite the magic behind it being gone since I know how it works; It is still one of my favourite topics!!
* 📖 Writing, it has always been a passion of mine, mapping my ideas and creativity in the form of words will never not be fun!
* 🎶 Poetry and Music, I would share my work with you, but let's not go there.... If anyone ever saw the stuff I write, I would be in a mental asylum (kinda suprised I have not been commited to one yet).
* 🤓 Last but certainly not least, MATHS (I know mentioned it before BUT GOD I LOVE MATHS!!)

So yeah if you ever feel like this mentally ill nerd is interesting (I know I am, thank you very much 😌), don't hesitate to hit me up and I'll explain finding optimization solutions in complex search spaces or yap for a few hours about greek literature 🤓! 

## Projects 👨🏻‍💻
Almost forgot about this part 😅
* LSTM, a sequence to sequence text generation model!
* Corrector Network, using neural networks in auto correct through various string similarity algorithms!
* Sign Language AI, using CNN to translate letters from ASL to English.
* NeoBatcher, an app to read manga or watch anime, not that related to AI but I spent a fair bit of time working on it!!

I have more projects but these are the ones I am most proud of 😌
